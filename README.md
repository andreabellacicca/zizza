	* **Name**: your full name.
	* **Email**: your email address.
	* **Password**: create a strong and unique password for your admin account.
3. Click **Create Account** to create your admin account.

**Note:** This step is only required for first-time users. If you have already created an admin account, proceed to Step 1.

### Step 1: Setup Your Wallet

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Wallet**.
2. Add your:
	* **NEAR Account ID**: enter your NEAR account ID.
	* **NEAR Private Key (PK)**: enter your NEAR private key.
	* **Zcash Wallet**: enter your existing Zcash wallet address or generate a new one.
3. Click **Save** to save your wallet settings.

**Note:** Please be aware that all wallet information, including private keys and addresses, is stored **locally** on your device and is **not** shared with anyone, including the TX Intent Server or any third-party services. Your wallet information remains confidential and secure, and is only used to facilitate transactions on your behalf.

### Step 2: Start a Conversation with the Agent

1. Start a conversation with the agent.
2. Ask the agent to perform actions using the following commands:
	* [List the available commands, e.g. "send NEAR", "send Zcash", "check balance", etc.]

Note: The agent will respond accordingly based on the commands you provide.

## Tips and Reminders
--------------------

* Make sure to save your wallet settings to ensure that your transactions are processed correctly.
* Be careful when entering your private keys and wallet addresses, as they are sensitive information.
* If you have any issues or concerns, refer to the [list the troubleshooting or support resources, e.g. FAQ, support email, etc.].

**Using Natural Language to Interact with ZizZA**
----------------------
ZizZA allows you to interact with the NEAR blockchain using natural language commands. You can phrase your requests in a way that feels most natural to you, and ZizZA will understand what you want to do.

For example, instead of using the specific command swap with the required parameters, you can simply say:

"I need to swap 10 wNEAR on the NEAR chain with ZEC"
"Can you exchange 5 wNEAR for ZEC on the NEAR blockchain?"
"I want to trade 10 wNEAR for ZEC on the NEAR chain"
"Swap 10 wNEAR for ZEC on the NEAR blockchain, please"

ZizZA will understand that you want to perform a swap operation, and will automatically extract the necessary parameters from your request to create a NEAR intent, such as:
asset_in_symbol: wNEAR
asset_in_chain: NEAR
asset_out_symbol: ZEC
asset_out_chain: NEAR
amount_in: 10

You can use this natural language approach for all of the supported commands, including:

"What's my balance of wNEAR on the NEAR chain?"
"Can you deposit 10 wNEAR into my account on the NEAR blockchain?"
"I want to withdraw 5 wNEAR from my account on the NEAR chain"
"What's the best quote for swapping 10 wNEAR for ZEC on the NEAR blockchain?"
By using natural language, you can interact with ZizZA in a more intuitive and user-friendly way, without having to remember specific command syntax or parameters.

Moreover, ZizZA can concatenate multiple commands, allowing the user to execute complex tasks. For example, the user can say "I want to send 10 wNEAR to this address and then swap 5 wNEAR for ZEC".

When a user interacts with ZizZA, the AI team works together to provide a seamless user experience and support interactions with the NEAR blockchain. Here's how the process works:

1. The user sends a request to the AI team, such as "I want to send 10 wNEAR to this address".
2. The ZizZA Help Desk assistant analyzes the request and tries to understand what commands the user wants to execute.
3. The ZizZA Help Desk assistant can concatenate multiple commands, allowing the user to execute complex tasks. For example, the user can say "I want to send 10 wNEAR to this address and then swap 5 wNEAR for ZEC".
4. The ZizZA Help Desk assistant will continue to prompt the user for additional information and clarify any unclear requests until the user is ready to execute the commands.
5. Once the user is satisfied with their request, they must type "execute" to confirm that they want to proceed with the commands.
6. When the user types "execute" the Help Desk Assistant send the commands to the ZizZA Command Converter assistant.
7. The ZizZA Command Converter assistant converts the commands into specific instructions for the NEAR blockchain.
8. The ZizZA Command Converter assistant sends the instructions to the NEAR blockchain for execution.
9. The NEAR blockchain executes the instructions and sends the results to the AI team.
10. The ZizZA Result Commenter assistant analyzes the results and comments on errors or anomalies.
11. The ZizZA Result Commenter assistant suggests a possible solution if an error or issue occurs.
12. The AI team provides a response to the user with the results and additional information as needed.
